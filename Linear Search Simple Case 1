#In this linear search algorithm, I have used only for loop to search the user input. This is the simplest linear search algorithm. 

DECLARE arrayData : ARRAY [1:10] OF INTEGER
DECLARE count, searchvalue : INTEGER
DECLARE found : BOOLEAN

arrayData = [10,4,5,6,7,8,3,2,1,99]
found <-- FALSE

OUTPUT "Enter a value you want to search"
INPUT searchvalue
FOR count = 1 TO 10
  IF searchvalue = arrayData[count]
  THEN found <-- TRUE
  ENDIF
NEXT

IF found
THEN OUTPUT "Value has been found"
ELSE OUTPUT "Value has not been found"
ENDIF
